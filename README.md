# “Ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone

### In total, there will be four parts to this project:

* Creating Static Components
* Passing Information to Components
* Setting the State of Ravenous Components
* Interacting with the Yelp API

### Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

* As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
* As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
* As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
